                                <p>Therapy, also known as counseling or psychotherapy, is a process where a trained therapist helps you address and resolve personal issues, mental health conditions, and emotional difficulties through discussion and various techniques.</p>

Therapy can help with a wide range of issues, not just severe mental health conditions.</p>

                                <p>The duration of therapy varies depending on individual needs and goals.

                                <p>Yes, therapy is generally confidential. Therapists are bound by ethical and legal guidelines to keep what you share private, with a few exceptions.
